I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making creative and meaningful experiences. 

I've been working professionally for 3 years in the games industry.
Some technologies I enjoy working with include Unity, Unreal Engine (C++ and BPs), .Net Framework, Azure and vanilla frontend (HTML, CSS and JS).
